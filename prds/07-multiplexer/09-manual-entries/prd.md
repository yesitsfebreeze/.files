<!-- Ordering reads three axes and no clock: dependency (needs + footprint),
     vision importance (priority), and complexity/blast-radius. Add your own
     keys freely, at any nesting. Nothing outside state, origin, from,
     priority, complexity, blast-radius, claim, repo, workflow, needs and
     footprint is read, and nothing you add is ever dropped.
       needs:     — PRD dir names this one depends on. A hard gate in `plan`
       footprint: — paths this PRD touches. The overlap check
       workflow:  — the route a worker is handed, expanded into its brief

     One sitting is the limit: specs summing `complexity` above `split-above`
     or counting above `specs-above` (both in prds/settings.md, default 40 and
     6) make the analyst's verdict REFINE, and `pearde refine` lands the split
     under `## Children` here — the contract above it stays as written.

     A derived PRD states, in the body, which requested PRD it would otherwise
     get wrong. If it cannot, it is filed `state: deferred` — and if fixing it
     would change only how loudly the board notices, it is a memo, not a PRD.

# 09-manual-entries — `home/dot_config/nushell/help/terminal.nuon` rewritten for the new bindings: the roughly 20 `kind: "wezterm-key"` verifications become `kind: "tmux-key"`, entries for F4 and the pane letters are added, and the ones describing the WezTerm floor go. tmux stays on the existing `terminal` surface and `help` gains no fifth `--mode`. The `tmux-key` resolver does not exist — file it as a requirement on `06-help/04-drift-check` against `tmux -L … list-keys`, and until it lands say plainly that those entries are documented and unverified rather than ticking a box that has not run.

<!-- Three more headings exist, and none of them is a slot to copy down. Each
     is a claim about the state of this PRD, so an empty copy of it is a false
     one: an empty `## Questions` stops the board on nothing, an empty
     `## Answers` reads as answered, an empty `## Failure` reads as a failed
     attempt. Write the heading when it has content; until then it is absent,
     which is the honest state. @resources/questions.py reports the empty
     ones, and `doctor`'s `questions` row runs it. -->

<!-- `## Questions` — analyst-only, when blocked on the user: one round in the
     format of drill.md — `### Q1: <title>`, the fork in 1-3 sentences ending
     in "?", then exactly three prepared answers, each a complete decision,
     one `(recommended)`. Only real forks the user must settle (naming, scope,
     cost) — never facts a worker could look up, never the PRD restated. A PRD
     parked on the user with no such round never says what it is asking. -->

<!-- `## Answers` — orchestrator-only (or the view), written after asking the
     user: `**Q1** — <the picked answer verbatim, or the user's own words>`,
     numbers matching the round above it. Analysts read these before speccing.
     An `## Answers` with no `## Questions` above it answers nothing. -->

<!-- `## Failure` — implementer-only, after a FAILED attempt: what broke, what
     was tried. `retry` moves this into the body as history and reopens the
     PRD. -->
